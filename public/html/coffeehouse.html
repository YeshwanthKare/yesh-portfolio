                            Coffee House is an international 
                            coffee shop app for daily coffee 
                            takers. For this project, we decided 
                            to use a goal-directed design method 
                            which revolves around focusing on 
                            our persona creation and goals. 
                            The MVP for this product was 
                            developed as a mobile based 
                            application rather than being 
                            web-based to showcase our mobile 
                            design skillset.​

                <p>
                    In this project, I took a goal-directed design 
                    approach that proved to be quite effective 
                    in my design efforts. I found qualitative 
                    research methods to be the most useful, 
                    consisting of a  literature review, 
                    competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews, 
                    and most important our persona hypothesis 
                    construction. I started out by asking myself 
                    some initial key questions.

                        group identified through research was working 
                        employee who has difficulty in attending his

                        facing during picking up the coffee order. 
                        The other factor was the user was not able to 
                        get the qualitative delivery when picking up 
                        the order due to the lack of time and the

                I found data from our Usability Study to 
                be the most effective understandings I garnered. 
                I then used an affinity diagram to separate the 
                data into groups of tasks which were further 
                categorized by high level goals for improvement 
                in efficiency, process, depth, and familiarity. 
                Recognizing the conflicts of interest from each 
                audience allowed us to focus on shaping user 
                goals and how those goals would in-turn also 
                affect the business' goals.

                    I constructed a user flow of what a basic 
                    start to finish journey looks like 
                    while purchasing an item. This helps us 
                    in understanding ways users can interact 
                    with the product, as well as gives me an understanding
                    to see navigation through user goals.

                        different scenarios in my prototype in
